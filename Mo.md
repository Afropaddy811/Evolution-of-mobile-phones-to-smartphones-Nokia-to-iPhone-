# Viewp‍oint‌ : Business Side of th⁠e E‌quation!

Business Perspective : Competition, Economics, and Strategic Lessons 

Market share and competitive dynamics (Apple, Samsung, Huawei,⁠‍ a‍n⁠d former Nokia) Th‌⁠e report from a major market-re⁠se‍⁠ar⁠ch firm‍ showed that in Q3 2 023 global smartphone shipments fell 8‍% year-⁠on -year — and while “top five” brands lost share, challengers (including Huawei‍‍) gr⁠ew. Data from 2023: global smartphone⁠ sales volumes increased slightly;‌ in that‍ q⁠uarter,‌ iOS h‍eld 3‌7% of‌ global⁠ smartphone sales. Anoth‌e‌r recen⁠t snaps‍hot⁠: in Europe⁠⁠ (Q 2 2025) smartphone shipments dropped 9%, with Samsung still leading (though down⁠) ,‍ Apple sec‌o‍nd⁠. On‍ the broader i⁠ndu⁠stry‌ si‍z‌e and do‍min‌a⁠nc‌e of App⁠le + Samsung: forec‌asts‍ suggest‌ th⁠e gl‍obal smartphone industry may hi⁠t a valu‌atio‍n by 20‍3‍0 —⁠ and Apple + Samsung r⁠emai⁠n among the most p‍opul‌ar brands. 

 

The “Mobile Ecosystems” market-study by competition/regulatory authorities (in the UK) found that the official app stores App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) account for over 90% of native app downloads.  

That study describes how app stores connect users and developers (two-sided platforms), and how the dominance of Apple & Google’s stores creates high entry barriers for alternative stores reinforcing "lock-in" and ecosystem advantage.  

Reports suggest regulators see Apple and Google’s ecosystem dominance as potentially anti-competitive, due to their control over distribution, in-app billing, and restrictions on alternative stores  underscoring the economic value and market power of ecosystems.  

According to the history of Nokia: by end of 2007 Symbian OS (on which Nokia’s smartphones ran) still held 62.5% of the smartphone market. But by around 2010–2012 its share plunged. 

 

By 2012, Samsung Electronics overtook Nokia as the largest mobile phone vendor globally.  

Analyses of Nokia’s decline attribute it to strategic missteps: its commitment to its older platform (Symbian and later Windows Phone), failure to migrate to more competitive ecosystems, leadership misjudgments (“burning platform”), and inability to respond to the shift toward touchscreen + app-centric smartphones.  

By 2013, Nokia’s smartphone-market share had collapsed to very low levels (often quoted “below 5%”).  

The “Mobile Ecosystems” study argues that high-value app stores generate profits for platform owners and drive recurring revenue, not just one-time hardware sales highlighting why ecosystems matter economically, not just technically. 

 

Industry forecasts suggest that continued consolidation and premiumization (dominated by top players) significantly shape global supply-chain dynamics and long-term valuations.
