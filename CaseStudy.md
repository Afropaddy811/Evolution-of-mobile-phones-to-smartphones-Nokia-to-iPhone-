## First Viewpoint Analysis: Business Perspective

For more than a century Nokia has showed amazing revolution and adaptability. Nokia started from its origins as a paper mill into a global telecommunications powerhouse. Originally venturing into businesses such as rubber and cables, Nokia changed into telecommunications in the 1960s get recognised for its major contribution. By the late 90s, Nokia had grown to be strongly associated with mobile technology, driving developments such as the first 2G call and constructing iconic mobile phones like the Nokia 3310.





## Apple's Entry 2007.

Nokia at one time the world’s largest mobile phone company has made a massive document of business assets available in a website compiled by Finland’s Aalto University the Nokia Design Documents. The interesting collection specifies deep understanding into how the company works in particular, a 2007 Nokia Confidential report caught my eye, as it captures what the company thought when Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007.

Much of the document focuses on price, Nokia thought the cost of the iPhone would repel customers from buying it. 
The company was also not that convinced about Apple’s touch interface, Nokia execs thought customers would want to stick with those small little QWERTY keyboards everyone used at the time but in the end, cost and keyboard did not form the competitive advantage Nokia anticipated because the iPhone was not only focused on users experience and the report shows Nokia directors were concerned.

## Change in business models: from hardware-focused to software and services.

Nokia made a lot of strategic shifts, including a strategic partnering with Microsoft that came with criticism and a change towards a B2B focused model. This transition saw Nokia focusing on telecommunications networks,5G and Business solutions leveraging its established capability to stay relevant in a fast evolving technological landscape. Additionally, Nokia embraced branching out into developing fields such as AI, cybersecurity, cloud computing and aligning itself with international technological trends and market demands. This paper looks at Nokia’s historical journey, examining its calculated decisions, market responses and the effects of its revolution from a mobile phone leader to a major player in network infrastructure. By studying Nokia’s trajectory this study provides understanding into how enterprises can navigate market commotions and re-establish significance through revolution and strategic realignment. The findings highlight Nokia’s flexibility and emphasise the critical importance of adaptableness in retaining competitiveness within the global telecommunications industry.

## How marketing, design, and consumer experience became key differentiators. 

Marketing, design and customer experience emerged as a very important differentiators in the smartphone industry as corporations changed from focusing only on hardware to building full customer focused ecosystems. Apple led this renovation by making sleek design a priority, insightful interfaces and a uniform user experience upheld by the App Store which drew developers and created a vibrant platform. By adopting this approach the smartphone evolved from a simple communication tool to an essential lifestyle accessory. Nokia by contrast stayed hardware-driven and take too lightly the growing importance of software quality, app accessibility and ecosystem integration. It’s marketing continued to highlight technical features instead of consumer experience, causing the company to fall behind as customer expectations advanced. As a result strong design, emotionally appealing branding and organized digital ecosystems became influential advantages that differentiated successful enterprises like Apple from rejecting competitors such as Nokia.

## Market share and financial shifts (e.g., Nokia’s fall, Apple’s rise in profits).

The shift to smartphones led to extraordinary changes in market share and financial performance across the mobile industry, most remarkably seen in Nokia’s rapid decline and Apple’s rise. Nokia once the world’s largest mobile phone manufacturer with dominant global market share started to lose value when it failed to compete well in the smartphone era. The blend of slow updates, platform crumbling and a weak app system led users and developers to change to alternatives. Meanwhile Apple’s iPhone supported by a valuable ecosystem built around iTunes and the App Store quickly became one of the most monetarily successful customer products in history. Apple’s hardware software incorporation, exceptional pricing strategy and strong loyalty allowed the business to capture an inconsistent share of industry profits. As Apple’s profits and global effect grew each year Nokia’s profits subsided, eventually forcing the enterprise to exit the smartphone market and shift toward network technologies. This financial and market-share shift demonstrates how quickly leadership can change when businesses fail to adapt to disruptive revolution.
