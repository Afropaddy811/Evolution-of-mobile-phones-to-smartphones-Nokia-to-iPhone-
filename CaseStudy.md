Nokia, established in   1865,  evolved   from   a paper   mill   to   a   global   telecommunications   powerhouse, reflecting   over   a   century   of   innovation   and   adaptability. Initially  venturing into  industries such  as  rubber  and cables, Nokia   transitioned   into   telecommunications   in   the   1960s, gaining   recognition  for  its  pioneering  contributions.   By  the late 20th century, Nokia had become synonymous with mobile technology, driving advancements such as the first 2G call and  iconic mobile phones like the Nokia 3310. However, despite its dominance in the mobile phone  market, challenges arose with the   introduction   of   smartphones,   particularly   from  competitors  like Apple and Samsung, and  Nokia struggled  to adapt   to   the  shift   towards   touchscreen   interfaces  and   app ecosystems.To   counteract  declining   market  share,  Nokia   undertook strategic  shifts,   including  a   controversial   partnership  with Microsoft  and   a   pivot  towards  a  B2B   model. This  shift   saw Nokia   focusing   on   telecommunications   networks,   5G technologies, and enterprise  solutions, leveraging its expertise to   remain   relevant   in   a   rapidly   evolving   tech   landscape. Additionally, Nokia embraced   diversification  into areas such as  AI,   cybersecurity,   and   cloud   computing,   aligning   with global trends and technological demands.This paper delves into Nokia's historical journey, analyzing  its strategic  decisions,  market adaptations,  and  the  impact of  its transformation from a mobile phone leader to a significant player   in   network   infrastructure.   By   examining   Nokia’s trajectory,  this   study   offers insights into how  companies   can  navigate   market   disruptions   and   re-establish   relevance through   innovation  and  strategic  realignment.   The   findings highlight   Nokia's   resilience   and   underscore   the   critical importance of adaptability in maintaining competitiveness in the global telecommunications industr
