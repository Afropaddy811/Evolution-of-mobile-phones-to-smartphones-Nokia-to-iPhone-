## First Viewpoint Analysis: Business Perspective

For more than a century Nokia has showed amazing revolution and adaptability. Nokia started from its origins as a paper mill into a global telecommunications powerhouse. Originally venturing into businesses such as rubber and cables, Nokia changed into telecommunications in the 1960s get recognised for its major contribution. By the late 90s, Nokia had grown to be strongly associated with mobile technology, driving developments such as the first 2G call and constructing iconic mobile phones like the Nokia 3310.





## Apple's Entry 2007.

Nokia at one time the world’s largest mobile phone company has made a massive document of business assets available in a website compiled by Finland’s Aalto University the Nokia Design Documents. The interesting collection specifies deep understanding into how the company works in particular, a 2007 Nokia Confidential report caught my eye, as it captures what the company thought when Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007.

Much of the document focuses on price, Nokia thought the cost of the iPhone would repel customers from buying it. 
The company was also not that convinced about Apple’s touch interface, Nokia execs thought customers would want to stick with those small little QWERTY keyboards everyone used at the time but in the end, cost and keyboard did not form the competitive advantage Nokia anticipated because the iPhone was not only focused on users experience and the report shows Nokia directors were concerned.

## Change in business models: from hardware-focused to software and services.

Nokia made a lot of strategic shifts, including a strategic partnering with Microsoft that came with criticism and a change towards a B2B focused model. This transition saw Nokia focusing on telecommunications networks,5G and Business solutions leveraging its established capability to stay relevant in a fast evolving technological landscape.
