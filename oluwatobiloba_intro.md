Introduction
The transformation from basic mobile phones to smartphones is one of the most important technological changes of the 21st century. 
It started out as an easy way to talk to people on the phone, but now it's an important, adaptable technology that transforms how billions of people work, talk to each other, hang out, and get information. 
The move from the big, brick-like cell phones of the 1980s to the sleek, app-driven smartphones of today shows how quickly technology changes and how dramatically business strategy and social behavior have changed around the world.
It's important to see how this has changed because mobile technology is now the basis for global communication systems, multinational business models, and everyday life for people all over the world.
Motorola and Nokia were among the first businesses to make cell phones. 
Motorola made some of the first phones that people could buy.  
Nokia was the world's most popular phone maker in the 1990s and early 2000s. 
People liked Nokia phones because they were easy to use, the batteries lasted a long time, and they lasted a long time. 
People liked talking on the phone more because of this.  Because the brand is so popular all around the world, cell phones go from being nice-to-have to must-have commodities. 
But the smartphone, especially the iPhone that Apple came up with in 2007, changed the game and what people thought mobile technology could do. 
The industry changed a lot when it went from physical buttons to touchscreens, from simple software to app-based ecosystems, and from devices that were mostly for communication to computing platforms that could do a lot of things.
This case study examines the evolution of mobile phones from traditional models, notably the Nokia brand, to contemporary devices, with Apple's iPhone at the forefront.
There are two main ways to look at this change: from a corporate point of view and from a social point of view. 
We chose a few different points of view because the rise of mobile devices isn't merely a technical success. 
It was also affected by changes in client wants and behaviors around the world, aggressive business practices, and changes in market leadership.
The corporate view looks at how businesses dealt with competition, new ideas, and changes in the market.
The social approach focuses at how mobile technology changed the way people talk to each other, how they live their lives, and how they interact with the digital world.
The business point of view is very essential because the mobile phone sector has changed more than any other industry in history.
Nokia moved from being the best in the business to virtually being useless, while Apple went from being a new player to a huge company.  
This is a great example of how to make strategic decisions, handle new ideas, and deal with big changes.  
The sociological point of view reveals how the ubiquitous use of cell phones has affected how people connect, talk to each other, receive information, and see themselves in social situations.
Smartphones made it easy to talk to people, but they also transformed how people interact with each other, how businesses work, and how individuals are creative.
The change from cell phones to smartphones is more than just a simple technological improvement.
It shows how business strategy and social change are connected in a deeper way. 
This case study looks at how Nokia's decision to migrate from mobile phones to Apple's smartphones affected the way people live and communicate throughout the world.
