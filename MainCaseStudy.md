# Business Perspective

# Nokia's Dominance: Led the mobile phone market in the early 2000s with inexpensive, durable phones and a strong global supply chain.

# Failed to Innovate: Did not react fast enough to the shift to smartphones and touch screens.

# iPhone Disruption (2007):

# Apple reimagined the phone as a software-based, app-focused ecosystem, not just a communications tool.

# Created a new business model: hardware + software + App Store.

# Market Shift:

# Apple and Android manufacturers gained market share.

# Nokia lagged behind; sold mobile business to Microsoft in 2014.

# New Economy: Smartphones enabled entire industries to emergeâ€”app development, mobile advertising, gig economy, e-commerce, etc.

# ???? Societal Perspective

# Nokia Era:

# Phones penetrated everyone across the globe, including developing nations.

# Focused on basic communication (calls, SMS).

# Smartphone Era (iPhone & Android):

# Changed societal behavior: always connected, social media usage, mobile banking, education, health apps.

# Changed how we work, socialize, shop, and even think.

# Created digital dependency, but also empowered communities (e.g., by access to information and services).
