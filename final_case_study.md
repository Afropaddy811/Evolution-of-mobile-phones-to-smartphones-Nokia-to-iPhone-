# Introduction 

The transformation from basic mobile phones to smartphones is one of the most important technological changes of the 21st century.  
It started out as an easy way to talk to people on the phone, but now it's an important, adaptable technology that transforms how billions of people work, talk to each other, hang out, and get information.  

The move from the big, brick-like cell phones of the 1980s to the sleek, app-driven smartphones of today shows how quickly technology changes and how dramatically business strategy and social behavior have changed around the world.  
It's important to see how this has changed because mobile technology is now the basis for global communication systems, multinational business models, and everyday life for people all over the world.

Motorola and Nokia were among the first businesses to make cell phones.  
Motorola made some of the first phones that people could buy.  
Nokia was the world's most popular phone maker in the 1990s and early 2000s.  

People liked Nokia phones because they were easy to use, the batteries lasted a long time, and they lasted a long time.  
People liked talking on the phone more because of this. Because the brand is so popular all around the world, cell phones go from being nice-to-have to must-have commodities.  

But the smartphone, especially the iPhone that Apple came up with in 2007, changed the game and what people thought mobile technology could do.  
The industry changed a lot when it went from physical buttons to touchscreens, from simple software to app-based ecosystems, and from devices that were mostly for communication to computing platforms that could do a lot of things.

This case study examines the evolution of mobile phones from traditional models, notably the Nokia brand, to contemporary devices, with Apple's iPhone at the forefront.  

There are two main ways to look at this change: from a corporate point of view and from a social point of view.  
We chose a few different points of view because the rise of mobile devices isn't merely a technical success.  
It was also affected by changes in client wants and behaviors around the world, aggressive business practices, and changes in market leadership.  

The corporate view looks at how businesses dealt with competition, new ideas, and changes in the market.  
The social approach focuses at how mobile technology changed the way people talk to each other, how they live their lives, and how they interact with the digital world.  

The business point of view is very essential because the mobile phone sector has changed more than any other industry in history.  
Nokia moved from being the best in the business to virtually being useless, while Apple went from being a new player to a huge company.  
This is a great example of how to make strategic decisions, handle new ideas, and deal with big changes.  

The sociological point of view reveals how the ubiquitous use of cell phones has affected how people connect, talk to each other, receive information, and see themselves in social situations.  
Smartphones made it easy to talk to people, but they also transformed how people interact with each other, how businesses work, and how individuals are creative.  

The change from cell phones to smartphones is more than just a simple technological improvement.  
It shows how business strategy and social change are connected in a deeper way.  
This case study looks at how Nokia's decision to migrate from mobile phones to Apple's smartphones affected the way people live and communicate throughout the world.

# Historical Development

## Timeline of Key Events

### 1973 – First mobile phone call made

The first handheld mobile phone prototype was demonstrated by Martin Cooper at Motorola.  
This event is widely considered the starting point of mobile phone history.

### 1983 – First commercial cellular phone: DynaTAC 8000X

Motorola released the first commercially available cell phone, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X.  
It was large and expensive but marked the beginning of consumer mobile telephony.

### 1990s – Transition to smaller, more accessible mobile phones (1G → 2G)

Through the 1990s, mobile phones became more common.  
The move from analogue (1G) to digital networks (2G) made phones more reliable and affordable.  
During this period, companies worked on making phones lighter, cheaper, and easier to use.

### Early 2000s – Feature phones and global expansion

Mobile phones in this era began to include more features  
(better battery, design improvements, basic data functions)  
and reached a broader audience worldwide.  

Mobile telephony expanded dramatically, setting the stage for smartphones.

### 2007 – The smartphone revolution begins with the first iPhone

The release of the Apple iPhone in 2007 marked a dramatic shift:  
capacitive touchscreen, modern OS, and a design focused on usability rather than keypads.  

This changed expectations — mobile phones were no longer just communication tools but smart devices.

### 2008 onwards – Rise of app ecosystems, smartphones proliferate

With rising smartphone adoption, mobile phones evolved rapidly:  
touchscreens became standard, internet and data services improved,  
and phones became multi-functional devices.  

This transformation shifted societal usage — phones became central to communication, information access, entertainment, and work.

### 2020s – Smartphones as central digital devices & continued evolution

By 2025, mobile phones are no longer just phones —  
they are central to how people communicate, work, browse, and consume media.  

Phones have drastically evolved from their “brick phone” origins to intelligent, versatile devices.

# First Viewpoint Analysis: Business Perspective

For more than a century Nokia has showed amazing revolution and adaptability. Nokia started from its origins as a paper mill into a global telecommunications powerhouse. Originally venturing into businesses such as rubber and cables, Nokia changed into telecommunications in the 1960s get recognised for its major contribution. By the late 90s, Nokia had grown to be strongly associated with mobile technology, driving developments such as the first 2G call and constructing iconic mobile phones like the Nokia 3310.

## Apple's Entry 2007

Nokia at one time the world’s largest mobile phone company has made a massive document of business assets available in a website compiled by Finland’s Aalto University the Nokia Design Documents. The interesting collection specifies deep understanding into how the company works in particular, a 2007 Nokia Confidential report caught my eye, as it captures what the company thought when Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007.

Much of the document focuses on price, Nokia thought the cost of the iPhone would repel customers from buying it.  
The company was also not that convinced about Apple’s touch interface, Nokia execs thought customers would want to stick with those small little QWERTY keyboards everyone used at the time but in the end, cost and keyboard did not form the competitive advantage Nokia anticipated because the iPhone was not only focused on users experience and the report shows Nokia directors were concerned.

## Change in business models: from hardware-focused to software and services

Nokia made a lot of strategic shifts, including a strategic partnering with Microsoft that came with criticism and a change towards a B2B focused model. This transition saw Nokia focusing on telecommunications networks, 5G and Business solutions leveraging its established capability to stay relevant in a fast evolving technological landscape. Additionally, Nokia embraced branching out into developing fields such as AI, cybersecurity, cloud computing and aligning itself with international technological trends and market demands. This paper looks at Nokia’s historical journey, examining its calculated decisions, market responses and the effects of its revolution from a mobile phone leader to a major player in network infrastructure. By studying Nokia’s trajectory this study provides understanding into how enterprises can navigate market commotions and re-establish significance through revolution and strategic realignment. The findings highlight Nokia’s flexibility and emphasise the critical importance of adaptableness in retaining competitiveness within the global telecommunications industry.

## How marketing, design, and consumer experience became key differentiators

Marketing, design and customer experience emerged as a very important differentiators in the smartphone industry as corporations changed from focusing only on hardware to building full customer focused ecosystems. Apple led this renovation by making sleek design a priority, insightful interfaces and a uniform user experience upheld by the App Store which drew developers and created a vibrant platform. By adopting this approach the smartphone evolved from a simple communication tool to an essential lifestyle accessory. Nokia by contrast stayed hardware-driven and take too lightly the growing importance of software quality, app accessibility and ecosystem integration. It’s marketing continued to highlight technical features instead of consumer experience, causing the company to fall behind as customer expectations advanced. As a result strong design, emotionally appealing branding and organized digital ecosystems became influential advantages that differentiated successful enterprises like Apple from rejecting competitors such as Nokia.

## Market share and financial shifts (e.g., Nokia’s fall, Apple’s rise in profits)

The shift to smartphones led to extraordinary changes in market share and financial performance across the mobile industry, most remarkably seen in Nokia’s rapid decline and Apple’s rise. Nokia once the world’s largest mobile phone manufacturer with dominant global market share started to lose value when it failed to compete well in the smartphone era. The blend of slow updates, platform crumbling and a weak app system led users and developers to change to alternatives. Meanwhile Apple’s iPhone supported by a valuable ecosystem built around iTunes and the App Store quickly became one of the most monetarily successful customer products in history. Apple’s hardware software incorporation, exceptional pricing strategy and strong loyalty allowed the business to capture an inconsistent share of industry profits. As Apple’s profits and global effect grew each year Nokia’s profits subsided, eventually forcing the enterprise to exit the smartphone market and shift toward network technologies. This financial and market-share shift demonstrates how quickly leadership can change when businesses fail to adapt to disruptive revolution.

# Business Perspective (Part 2): Competition, Economics, and Strategic Lessons 

Market share and competitive dynamics (Apple, Samsung, Huawei,⁠‍ a‍n⁠d former Nokia) Th‌⁠e report from a major market-re⁠se‍⁠ar⁠ch firm‍ showed that in Q3 2 023 global smartphone shipments fell 8‍% year-⁠on -year — and while “top five” brands lost share, challengers (including Huawei‍‍) gr⁠ew. Data from 2023: global smartphone⁠ sales volumes increased slightly;‌ in that‍ q⁠uarter,‌ iOS h‍eld 3‌7% of‌ global⁠ smartphone sales. Anoth‌e‌r recen⁠t snaps‍hot⁠: in Europe⁠⁠ (Q 2 2025) smartphone shipments dropped 9%, with Samsung still leading (though down⁠) ,‍ Apple sec‌o‍nd⁠. On‍ the broader i⁠ndu⁠stry‌ si‍z‌e and do‍min‌a⁠nc‌e of App⁠le + Samsung: forec‌asts‍ suggest‌ th⁠e gl‍obal smartphone industry may hi⁠t a valu‌atio‍n by 20‍3‍0 —⁠ and Apple + Samsung r⁠emai⁠n among the most p‍opul‌ar brands. 

## Ecosystem Power (App Store & Google Play) 

The “Mobile Ecosystems” market-study by competition/regulatory authorities (in the UK) found that the official app stores App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) account for over 90% of native app downloads.  

That study describes how app stores connect users and developers (two-sided platforms), and how the dominance of Apple & Google’s stores creates high entry barriers for alternative stores reinforcing "lock-in" and ecosystem advantage.  

Reports suggest regulators see Apple and Google’s ecosystem dominance as potentially anti-competitive, due to their control over distribution, in-app billing, and restrictions on alternative stores underscoring the economic value and market power of ecosystems.  

According to the history of Nokia: by end of 2007 Symbian OS (on which Nokia’s smartphones ran) still held 62.5% of the smartphone market. But by around 2010–2012 its share plunged.  
By 2012, Samsung Electronics overtook Nokia as the largest mobile phone vendor globally.  

Analyses of Nokia’s decline attribute it to strategic missteps: its commitment to its older platform (Symbian and later Windows Phone), failure to migrate to more competitive ecosystems, leadership misjudgments (“burning platform”), and inability to respond to the shift toward touchscreen + app-centric smartphones.  

By 2013, Nokia’s smartphone-market share had collapsed to very low levels (often quoted “below 5%”).  

The “Mobile Ecosystems” study argues that high-value app stores generate profits for platform owners and drive recurring revenue, not just one-time hardware sales highlighting why ecosystems matter economically, not just technically.  

Industry forecasts suggest that continued consolidation and premiumization (dominated by top players) significantly shape global supply-chain dynamics and long-term valuations.  

Global Smartphones shipments dropped with challenges sometimes gaining share with top brands can slow downs.  

Apple and Samsung remain the top brands, benefiting from good brand loyalty and expensive products.  

Market Concentration benefit top players, shaping supply chains and long term industry value.  

App ecosystem, like the app store and google play, control the majority of app distribution, creating high entry barriers.  

Nokia’s decline highlights the risks of failing to adapt to new platforms and ecosystem-focused competition.

# Second Viewpoint Analysis: Societal Perspective

## Defining the Societal Viewpoint

The societal viewpoint focuses on how a computing or communication technology influences communities, institutions, and collective wellbeing rather than just individual experiences. In the case of mobile phones, society evaluates how widespread phone adoption affects social interaction, education, economic opportunity, family life, moral values, and public health. The Pew Research Center’s multi-country study provides evidence of how people across 11 nations perceive the social consequences of mobile-phone use.

## The Transformation Through Society’s Eyes

Across the surveyed countries, large majorities view mobile phones as having a positive influence on society. A median of 70% say that mobile-phone use has been mostly good for their society overall. One of the strongest perceived benefits is improved communication. A median of 93% of users state that mobile phones help them stay in touch with friends and family who live far away, while only 1% say phones make long-distance connection harder.

Many also believe that phones improve access to information: in nearly all countries, majorities report that their phones help them obtain important news, with figures ranging from 73% in Vietnam to 88% in Kenya. These findings show how mobile phones are seen as tools that strengthen connectivity and information access at a societal level.

Another widely recognised benefit relates to education and economic life. A median of 67% say that increased mobile-phone use has had a good influence on education. Similarly, 58% believe phones have positively affected the economy, and 56% say the same for culture. These perceptions suggest that many people see mobile phones not only as communication devices but as enabling participation in learning, economic opportunity, and cultural exchange.

## Social Concerns Identified in Society

Although most respondents highlight positive societal effects, the Pew study reveals strong concerns — particularly regarding children. In eight of the 11 countries surveyed, a majority say that mobile-phone use has had a bad influence on children today. A median of 79% of adults believe that people should be very concerned about children being exposed to harmful or inappropriate content through mobile phones. This shows a major societal tension: while mobile phones expand access to information, they may also threaten child safety and wellbeing.

Health concerns are another significant issue. In countries such as Lebanon (71%), Jordan (69%), and Tunisia (63%), large majorities say mobile-phone use has had a bad effect on physical health. Opinions about morality are also mixed. A median of 34% say phones have a good influence on moral values, while similar proportions believe they have a negative impact. These findings indicate that societies associate mobile-phone use with broader cultural and ethical challenges.

Productivity and social behaviour also show divided opinions. In some countries, majorities say mobile phones help them save time or concentrate, while in others many feel phones distract them or reduce focus. Views on face-to-face communication are also mixed: while people value long-distance connection, some believe phones may weaken in-person interaction and family cohesion.

## Specific Societal Evidence

- **93%** say phones help maintain long-distance relationships.  
- **67%** say phones improve education.  
- **58%** believe phones positively affect the economy.  
- **79%** say people should be very concerned about children’s exposure to harmful content.  
- **Up to 71%** in some countries say phones negatively affect physical health.

## Connection to Module Concepts

This analysis reflects the module’s societal viewpoint by showing how mobile technologies create both opportunities and challenges for communities. It demonstrates how a single computing technology can reshape communication norms, influence educational and economic participation, and raise ethical concerns about wellbeing and equity.
